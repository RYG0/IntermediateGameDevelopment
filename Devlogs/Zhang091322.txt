I think concept artist and character artist sound like good roles for me. For most works done in the past two semesters, I was in charge of the part. Besides, I personally
enjoyed doing art related works for games. I am not sure if i am suitable to work within the industry, which I suppose in most cases i will be working with other people in groups. 
I would love to be a freelancer artist also. UI designer or simply be a player are good choices for me too.

I think community manager is a hard role. It may sounds like an easy job but it acutally, I assume, has a lot of things to do with subjects other than game design. It is also a job
that requires strong responsibility and capacity. If I were to look after a game community for a week I would be so dead hearing all the things people talk about.
