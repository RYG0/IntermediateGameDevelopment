- Devlog prompt: Discuss your process of working on your Rube Goldberg machine!
I had a hard time working on this project. I googled about the machine that we have to recreate in Unity 
for about an hour and I am still struggling between what I want to achieve and what I was able to do on my own.
I gave up a lot of ideas since I was still trying to figure out the way how different rigidbodies, colliders, and joints work.

I also made a mistake understanding the requirements of the assignment. I thought we have to make three camera positions and once
we press on a certain button, the camera switched between each other. the fact is that we have to make the camera autmaticlly continues to 
the next one once it reaches a certain place.

The process is frustrating but I did learnt more about the content of this week as I dig in. Generally the work is fine but 
I would say there are still a lot things I can improve.
