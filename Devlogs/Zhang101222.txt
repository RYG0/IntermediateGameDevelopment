Discuss your process of working on your 2-week landscape game!
NEW: Write down 1 question you have about Unity or development in 
general (preferably nothing listed in the syllabus).This is an opportunity
for you to request topics we may not cover by the end of class! 
*These questions do not count toward your 100 word minimum.

I spent most of my time configuring those random falling items, and I made players either gain
points or lose health depending on the item type they collect. It took me a long while to connect
the health bar and the score system to the actual start screen and end screen. once the player reach
a certain score or loses all the health, he will enter the end screen and get to choose if he would like
to do it again. Since I only have one level, I did not really need to worry about keeping the scores.

I also spent quite a time to adjust the gravity and moving speed of my player. I added the jump feature to
the character and I had some problems with this jump abilities. I need the player to be able to jump only
when he is standing on the ground, otherwise he will fly away while spaming the space button. Luckily I solved it
by adding a empty gameobject to detect the collision between player character and the platform.

I do wonder how to create particle effects in unity. we've already seen the trail effect and I think it is also
useful that we get to use particle effects especially when a collision occurs.
