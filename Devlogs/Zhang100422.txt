Talk about your landscape game - what types of games come to mind? what can you do
with what you have? Talk about your brainstorming process.

My landscape game is actually a 2d recreation of the bobst liberary. the building itself is normal and
pretty flat I would say, the thing that interests me is the food cart I added and I thought it would be 
funny if I can utilize for my game. I then thought about making a catch game where player control a mini cart
to catch food that were falling randomly. there is quite a space that I can play around with these collectable items
falling from sky. most of them are going to save player from running out of time and gain credits, some of them will
give the player a buff to move quicker and jump higher. once the player reach a certain score, items with debuff will 
appear in game and do damage to players.
