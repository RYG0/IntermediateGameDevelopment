I spent most of time working on the random enmey spawn system and a simple AI that make them
chase the player. in order to do that, I went through stuff about substantiating objects and
apply it to my own game. I set it so enemies will always spawn in random positions outside the
camera and slowly chase the player. eventually I will make the enemies accelerate and reach a higher
speed. I am also working on the shooter system and I needed more time on that. I plan to do multi-weapon
system and each of them runs seperately. players can aim with their mouse for the first weapon while
the second one would auto-aim the enemies.

I just wonder if there is any website that we can look at besides the Unity documentation, I sometimes just
found myself lost and cluless about how to achieve a certain feature, which could ususally be done by
using a simple function that I never heard about.
